# 347. Top K Frequent Elements

# Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
# Output: [1,2]
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [1], k = 1
# Output: [1]
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 105
# -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
# k is in the range [1, the number of unique elements in the array].
# It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
 

# Follow up: Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.
